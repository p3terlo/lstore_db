## Project Structure

"recommended that each member lead one aspect of the project while contributing and learning about other parts"

1. memory management (e.g., bufferpool)
2. disk management (e.g., persistence and logging)
3. in-memory indexing (e.g., hashing or tree)
4. data access methods (e.g., APIs and query language)
5. multi-threading and synchronization (e.g., data structures latching)
6. transaction and concurrency (e.g., record-level locking)
7. testing and benchmarking (correctness verification and performance measurements)

## Milestone Presentation Structure

(15 Minutes are strictly enforced)
- The milestone overview: the design and solution, what was accomplished and how? (8 minutes)
- Q/A: Questions about various aspects of the project (4 minutes)
- Demo: A live demonstration of the code, which includes adding, modifying, and querying the data (3 minutes)
